# Life-Expectancy
I decided to perform an analysis of the effect of immunizations on Life Expectancy over a period of time. The Life Expectancy data set published by the World Health Organization (WHO) focuses on data related to average life expectancy for 193 countries from the years 2000-2015. The dataset includes 21 predicting variables across the various categories, out of which, I will be focusing on Immunization.  I will be performing an analysis on the effect of Hepatitis B (HepB), Measles, Polio (Pol3), and Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunizations on the Life Expectancy of developing and developed countries throughout the years 2000-2015.
